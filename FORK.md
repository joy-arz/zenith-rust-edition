# Offline accounts and self-hosted servers

This fork adds ordinary offline access to the Horizon launcher and invitations for servers hosted on your own computer. Microsoft sign-in is optional for offline play. Existing Minecraft installations are reused first. When offline access is enabled and an offline profile is selected, missing game files download automatically from Mojang using the pinned manifests and hashes. Online-mode servers retain their authentication requirements.

## Use the launcher

1. Install a Horizon game version. Select your offline profile, then press **Play**. Zenith reuses an existing Minecraft installation or downloads missing files, obtains the required Java runtime, prepares resources, and starts the game. The first setup needs internet access; verified completed downloads are reused after interruption.
2. Open **Settings → Account**. Add an offline name (3–16 letters, digits or underscores) and select **Play as**. **Offline access** is visible in Settings and enabled by default.
3. Select **Custom skin… → Choose a skin…** beside that name. Import a 64×64 or legacy 64×32 PNG and choose Classic or Slim arms. The launcher stores a copy per profile and uses it at the next game launch. This existing skin feature renders your own player locally; it does not distribute the PNG to other players or vanilla clients.
4. Open **Servers → Create a server**. New servers allow offline accounts by default. List your friends' offline usernames. The first listed player is the operator. Accept the EULA and create the server.
5. Change the local game port in the server's **Settings** if needed, then start the server. Existing servers retain their settings: disable **account checks** to let offline accounts join.
6. On the host computer, use **Join on this computer**. This opens the selected game on the server's local address and game port. Players on the same network can use the separate LAN address.
7. For friends on another network, install and sign in to Tailscale on both computers. In Tailscale's **Machines** page, share the host computer with your friend and have them accept. In Zenith's **Over the internet** panel, use **Copy server link**. Your friend can paste it into **Multiplayer → Add Server** while connected to Tailscale. The link carries an address; sharing the machine grants access. No router change or Tailscale API token is needed for this setup.
8. If you already manage a public TCP port, **Own port forwarding** can save that address and generate the same type of link. Keep the management, panel and RCON ports private.

The share link is `zenith://server/HOST:PORT`. It is a pasteable invitation, not a hosted webpage or a registered browser protocol. The launcher does not configure your router, discover your public IP, or claim that the port is reachable. Use Tailscale if the router cannot forward ports or the ISP uses CGNAT. Update the saved address when your public IP changes, or use dynamic DNS.

Offline names are not authenticated. A whitelist limits names, but cannot prove who owns one. Share the endpoint with trusted friends and keep backups.

## Command line

After building the launcher, use its executable as `horizon-launcher` below:

```sh
horizon-launcher account offline Builder_1
horizon-launcher account skin Builder_1 /absolute/path/to/skin.png --model slim
horizon-launcher play

horizon-launcher servers create --name "Friends" --port 25565 --offline \
  --player Builder_1 --player Friend_2 --accept-eula
horizon-launcher servers run "Friends" -- start
horizon-launcher servers share "Friends" --address play.example.com:25570
horizon-launcher play --server zenith://server/play.example.com:25570
```

`play.example.com:25570` is an example: replace it with your actual public address and external port. This example forwards external TCP 25570 to local TCP 25565. `servers share` without `--address` prints the saved invitation; `--json` returns the address and link. No relay, Tailscale login or Microsoft account is required for this connection.

`servers create --check-accounts` explicitly creates an online-mode server. `settings offline-access off` restores the launcher's account requirement for offline profiles; `settings offline-access on` enables offline access again. Existing server authentication settings are never migrated automatically.

## Build and verification

The launcher is a separate Cargo workspace:

```sh
cargo build --release --manifest-path launcher/Cargo.toml
```

On a Mac without the Metal compiler, append `--features gpui_platform/runtime_shaders`.

Release builds check this fork's launcher releases from inside the app. Use the app's Update action to install and restart; the existing updater verifies the archive checksum and this fork's Ed25519 signature before replacement. Development builds keep self-update disabled. Game installation and updates retain upstream releases and their separate signing key. No Minecraft resources are included in the repository or release archives; game files are fetched at runtime into the launcher data folder.

Focused checks:

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path launcher/Cargo.toml --lib server_share::tests
cargo test --manifest-path launcher/Cargo.toml --lib skins::tests
python3 tools/pr_ready.py --base upstream/main --quick
```

A live game requires prepared resources. To verify external reachability, test from a second network using Tailscale or a reachable public TCP address. Unit tests cannot establish internet reachability.

## Release through GitHub Actions

The **Zenith release** workflow builds Linux x86-64, Windows x64 and ARM64, macOS Apple Silicon and macOS Intel on GitHub-hosted runners. It runs launcher tests, packages the app, signs `SHA256SUMS`, verifies the signature against `launcher/release-keys.txt`, and publishes the matching archives. The signing key is stored only in the fork's `FORK_RELEASE_SIGNING_KEY` Actions secret. The upstream launcher release workflow is gated to the upstream repository.

Run **Actions → Zenith release → Run workflow**, select the implementation branch, and enter a new three-part version such as `0.3.1`. Alternatively, push a tag such as `launcher@0.3.1` on the desired commit. Use increasing versions. The workflow refuses to overwrite an existing release. Once installed initially, release builds obtain later launcher versions through the in-app Update action.

Automatic registry updates retain a content mod's enabled or disabled state. Automatic game updates mark their Nightly installations for retention cleanup; manual and legacy installs, selected and instance-pinned versions, and running versions keep their protections.

### Zenith game previews

Zenith Rust Edition is the default game. The launcher downloads the newest
signed build for your platform from the [public Zenith releases](https://github.com/joy-arz/Zenith/releases).
No GitHub account or token is needed. Turn off automatic installs in Settings
to choose a build yourself in **Versions**. The default instance is **Zenith**.

Horizon compatibility builds remain available in **Versions**. An instance
pinned to a specific build keeps using that build. Older installed Zenith builds
remain available for rollback.

From a terminal, `horizon-launcher install latest` installs Zenith;
`horizon-launcher install horizon-latest` selects the Horizon compatibility
channel.

The engine preview workflow signs releases from `main` in the public
[engine repository](https://github.com/joy-arz/zenith-rust-edition) when
`publish_preview=true`. The signing key is scoped to the
`zenith-engine-release` environment.

To reuse a verified build from the public Zenith repo, tag its exact source
commit in the engine repo and upload the verified assets to a draft release
at that tag. Dispatch the signing workflow with `publish_preview=true`,
the exact `source_commit`, and the SHA-256 of the verified `SHA256SUMS` as
`draft_checksums_sha256`. Copy the signed release to the public Zenith
release catalog so existing launchers can install it.
